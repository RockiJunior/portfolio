			'I completed an intensive bootcamp where I learned to create Single Page Applications (SPA) and participated in their development, engaging in all facets including web and database design, backend development, and frontend development. The bootcamp lasted for 4 months, during which I acquired teamwork skills and learned to use versioning tools such as GitHub. Additionally, I delved into various technologies and dedicated time to self-learning throughout the application development process. \n I also focused on learning how to deploy applications using AWS (EC2), Ngrok, and several libraries to complement project functionalities. This experience enhanced my understanding of the entire application lifecycle from development to deployment.',
